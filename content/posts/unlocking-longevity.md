Red light therapy, also known as photobiomodulation (PBM), is a therapeutic technique that uses low-level wavelengths of red light to treat various conditions. It's gaining popularity as a non-invasive way to improve skin health, reduce inflammation, and even boost cognitive function.

## How Red Light Therapy Works

Red light therapy works by stimulating the mitochondria in your cells, which are the powerhouses of the cell. This increased energy production can lead to a variety of health benefits.

### 1. Cellular Energy Boost
- **ATP Production:** Red light stimulates the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell.
- **Improved Cell Function:** With more energy, cells can function more efficiently, repair damage, and replicate faster.

### 2. Reduced Inflammation
- **Anti-inflammatory Effects:** Red light therapy has been shown to reduce inflammation by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines.
- **Pain Relief:** This reduction in inflammation can lead to significant pain relief for conditions like arthritis and muscle soreness.

# Research-Based Foods That Are Good for Bloating

Based on comprehensive scientific research, here are the foods that have been clinically studied and proven effective for reducing bloating symptoms:

## Evidence-Based Anti-Bloating Foods

### Fruits with Clinical Support

**Bananas**  have been specifically shown in studies to reduce bloating. Research demonstrates that banana consumption may reduce the number of gas-causing bacteria in the gut. In one small clinical study, people who were given a banana as a pre-meal snack experienced significantly less bloating than those who weren't.[^1]

**Berries (Strawberries, Blueberries, Blackberries)**  contain polyphenols that help relieve IBS symptoms including bloating through their effects on gut health and inflammation. According to a 2023 review, polyphenols found in berries may help relieve IBS symptoms like bloating due to their effects on gut health. Berries are also low in fructose and FODMAPs, which can promote bloating and gas.[^2][^1]

**Pineapple**  contains the enzyme bromelain, which aids digestion and helps relieve symptoms like bloating, heartburn, and indigestion. A 2024 review highlights that bromelain may help with digestion and alleviate symptoms of indigestion, bloating, and heartburn due to its anti-inflammatory properties.[^3][^2]

**Kiwi**  contains actinidin, an enzyme that helps improve digestion and speed up stomach emptying. Research shows kiwi may help reduce digestive symptoms like bloating, stomach pain, and constipation.[^2]

**Papaya**  contains papain, an enzyme that helps break down amino acids and encourages healthy digestion. A 2022 mouse study suggests that papain can help support healthy gut bacteria health.[^3][^2]

### Vegetables with Research Support

**Ginger**  has extensive research showing its ability to soothe digestive distress. Studies demonstrate that ginger could speed up stomach emptying to prevent bloating and feelings of fullness.[^2]

**Celery**  comprises about 95% water and contains mannitol, a sugar alcohol that softens stools and promotes regularity by pulling water into the digestive tract. This helps relieve bloating and constipation.[^2]

**Asparagus**  provides nearly 3 grams of fiber per cup and contains inulin, a prebiotic fiber. Studies show that inulin may support gut health and increase regularity, which helps prevent bloating and constipation.[^2]

**Fennel**  seeds are a common digestive aid that may help relieve gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating, flatulence, and indigestion. Fennel seeds possess antispasmodic properties that help relax intestinal tract muscles.[^2]

**Turmeric**  contains curcumin, which has been extensively studied for anti-inflammatory effects. Studies show that turmeric helps decrease bloating in people with IBS, which often leads to increased gas production.[^1]

### Grains and Fiber Sources

**Oats**  provide soluble fiber that may help relieve bloating by reducing intestinal gas production and regulating bowel movements. A 1/2-cup serving contains 4 grams of fiber.[^3][^2]

**Quinoa**  is a gluten-free grain that may help people who experience bloating after eating gluten-containing foods. It's rich in fiber and antioxidants that may help combat bloating.[^2]

## Clinical Research on Macronutrient Effects

### OmniHeart Trial Findings

**Carbohydrate vs. Protein Effects**  The landmark OmniHeart study examined 164 participants in a randomized crossover trial comparing high-fiber diets with different macronutrient compositions. The study found that substitution of protein with carbohydrate may be an effective strategy to decrease bloating. The protein-rich diet increased bloating risk by 40% compared to the carbohydrate-rich diet (relative risk = 1.40).[^4][^5]

The study showed that compared to baseline, the relative risk of bloating was:

- Carbohydrate-rich diet: 1.34 (not statistically significant)
- Protein-rich diet: 1.78 (significant increase)
- Unsaturated fat-rich diet: 1.63 (significant increase)[^4]


## Probiotic Foods with Clinical Evidence

### Fermented Dairy Products

**Yogurt and Fermented Milk Products**  Studies show that yogurt and other fermented milk products may improve bloating and other markers of gastrointestinal health. The digestive benefits are specifically due to the fermentation process, not just the milk itself.[^6][^1]

**Kefir and Fermented Dairy**  contain probiotic strains that have been shown to suppress inflammation by modulating immune response, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines.[^6]

### Other Fermented Foods

**Fermented Vegetables**  like pickles, kimchi, and sauerkraut can help with bloating when regularly included in the diet. These foods change the gut microbiome and improve digestive health through bacterial fermentation processes.[^1]

## Specific Probiotic Strains for Bloating

### Clinical Trial Evidence

**Multi-Strain Probiotics**  are more effective than single-strain supplements for bloating reduction. An umbrella meta-analysis of 15 studies showed that probiotic supplementation reduced the risk of bloating by 26% (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84).[^7]

**Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus Strains**  Clinical studies show specific strains provide bloating relief:[^8]

- *Bifidobacterium infantis* 35624 improved bloating symptoms in IBS patients
- VSL\#3 probiotic formulation reduced bloating in multiple controlled studies
- *Lactobacillus acidophilus* and *Bifidobacterium lactis* improved bloating severity in an 8-week trial[^8]

**Saccharomyces boulardii and Enterococcus faecium**  A randomized clinical trial of 39 airline pilots with chronic gastritis showed that probiotic supplementation significantly reduced gastric pain and bloating compared to control groups.[^9]

## Anti-Inflammatory Diet Components

### Research-Supported Anti-Inflammatory Foods

**Fatty Fish**  like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are potent anti-inflammatories that support gut health and reduce bloating-related inflammation.[^10][^11]

**Nuts and Seeds**  including almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds offer healthy fats and antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and support digestive health.[^10]

**Olive Oil**  Extra virgin olive oil provides monounsaturated fats and antioxidants that combat inflammation and support gut health.[^11][^10]

**Leafy Greens**  such as spinach, kale, and collards are confirmed anti-inflammatory foods that support overall digestive health.[^11]

## Foods to Approach Carefully

### High-Fiber Considerations

**Fiber Timing and Type**  While fiber is beneficial, adding too much too quickly can lead to gas, bloating, and cramping. Research shows that individuals who reduced fiber intake had less bloating and abdominal pain in some cases.[^12][^13]

**Soluble vs. Insoluble Fiber**  UCLA Health research indicates eating less soluble fiber (beans, nuts, seeds, fruits) may help since these foods generally produce more gas than insoluble fiber sources.[^14]

### FODMAP Considerations

**Low-FODMAP Approach**  Current research summarizes that low-FODMAP diets show significant efficacy in reducing functional abdominal bloating and distension through systematic elimination of fermentable carbohydrates.[^15]

**Fruit Selection**  Mayo Clinic research advises avoiding high-fructose fruits like apples, pears, and watermelon, instead choosing bananas, oranges, cantaloupe, and darker-hued fruits.[^16]

These research-backed foods provide evidence-based options for individuals seeking to reduce bloating symptoms through dietary modifications, with clinical studies supporting their effectiveness in improving digestive comfort and reducing gas-related symptoms.

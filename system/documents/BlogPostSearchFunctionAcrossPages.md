Got it — you want a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for a **Blog Post Search** function.  

Here’s a clear, structured PRD you can use and adapt:  

***

## **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**  
### Feature: Blog Post Search Function  

***

### **1. Overview**
The Blog Post Search function will allow users to quickly find relevant blog content by typing keywords or phrases. Search results will be displayed in order of relevance, helping users discover posts more efficiently and improving site engagement.

***

### **2. Goals & Objectives**
- **Primary Goal:** Enable users to locate blog posts by title, content, tags, or author through a simple, intuitive search.
- **Objectives:**
  - Improve content discoverability.
  - Reduce bounce rates by keeping users engaged with relevant content.
  - Provide fast and accurate search results.

### **3. Key Features & Requirements**

#### 3.1 Functional Requirements
- **Search Bar UI:**
  - Positioned prominently at the top of the blog page.
  - Placeholder text: “Search blog posts…”
  - Auto-suggestion dropdown with popular or recent search terms (optional / advanced).
  
- **Search Scope:**
  - Title
  - Body text
  - Tags / Categories
  - Author names
  
- **Search Results Page:**
  - List view showing:
    - Blog post title (clickable)
    - Excerpt (first ~150 characters or most relevant matched snippet)
    - Publish date
    - Associated tags/categories
  - Results sorted by:
    1. Relevance
    2. Newest first (configurable)
  
- **Filtering & Sorting:**
  - Filter by category/tag.
  - Sort by relevance or recency.
  
- **Pagination / Infinite Scroll:**
  - Default: 10 results per page or equivalent lazy load.
  
- **No Results State:**
  - Show “No posts found” message.
  - Suggest related tags or popular content.

***

#### 3.2 Non-functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Search returns results within 500ms for 95% of queries.
- **Scalability:** Able to handle large blog archives (>10,000 posts) without noticeable slowdown.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Fully functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Accessibility:** Compatible with screen readers, ARIA labels for input field.

***

#### 3.3 Technical Considerations
- **Search Engine Options:**
  - Option 1: Database full-text search (e.g., MySQL/MariaDB `FULLTEXT`, PostgreSQL `tsvector`).
  - Option 2: External search service (e.g., Elasticsearch, Meilisearch, Algolia) for better scalability and fuzzy matching.
  
- **Indexing:**
  - Maintain up-to-date search index upon post creation/edit/deletion.
  
- **Security:**
  - Input sanitization to prevent SQL injection or XSS.

### **4. User Stories**
1. **As a reader**, I want to type a keyword in the search box so I can find blog posts matching my interest.
2. **As a reader**, I want to filter results by tags so I can narrow down to specific topics.
3. **As a reader**, I want to sort results by newest so I can see the latest content first.
4. **As an editor**, I want new posts to be searchable immediately after publishing.

***

### **5. Success Metrics**
- Increase in average time on site per visitor.
- Increase in blog post page views per session.
- Reduction in bounce rate from the blog homepage.
- Search-to-click conversion rate ≥ 30%.

***

### **6. Risks & Mitigation**
- **Risk:** Search performance degrades with large datasets.  
  - *Mitigation:* Use optimized indexing or external search service.
- **Risk:** Users receive irrelevant results.  
  - *Mitigation:* Implement relevance algorithm tweaks and track search analytics.

### **7. Timeline**
| Phase | Task | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | Requirements & Design | 1 week |
| 2 | Backend Search Implementation | 2 weeks |

If you want, I can also create a **wireframe** for how the search bar and results page should look, so the PRD is more developer/designer-friendly.  

Do you want me to prepare that visual as well?

To improve your Markdown (.md) file layout UI so that it matches the clarity and modern look of a Perplexity-style page, follow these best practices and structure guidelines. This set of instructions is designed to ensure your .md file is visually appealing, scannable, and user-friendly, even before any custom CSS or site conversion.

***

# Your Title (H1 Header)

> *Short, clear introduction—one or two sentences stating the purpose of the page, mirroring Perplexity’s direct style.*

[TOC] 

***

## Section Heading (H2)

- **Use bold for key points** and *italics* for emphasis.
- Write in short bullet points for clarity and visual rhythm.
- Limit paragraphs to 2–3 lines for readability.

### Subsection (H3)

1. Use ordered lists for stepwise guides or processes.
2. Always keep items concise.
3. Start each item with an actionable verb.

***

## Visuals & Media

- ![Descriptive alt diagrams, screenshots, or charts where helpful. (If using Mermaid or other tools, embed as code blocks:)
  ```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
  ```
- For videos:
  ```

## Key Tips to Mimic Perplexity UI

- **Consistent Heading Hierarchy:** Use H1 for the page title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections—never skip levels.
- **Single-column Layout:** Avoid sidebars/footers inside the md file. Content should flow top-down.[1][2]
- **Whitespace:** Use horizontal rules (`---`) to divide sections and provide space for the reader’s eye.
- **No Over-Nesting:** Avoid deep lists and sublists. Flat structure aligns with Perplexity’s minimal, friendly UI.
- **Scannability:** Make generous use of lists and tables. Avoid dense, blocky text.
- **Images and Visual Elements:** Incorporate visual content where relevant to break up text and aid comprehension.[2][3]
- **References and Links:** Add links with descriptive text, not just plain URLs.

Example:
```markdown

## Final Section/Conclusion

Use a call-to-action or summary sentence, e.g.:
> *Now you’re ready to create research summaries or guides that look clear, modern, and professional—just like Perplexity AI’s pages.*

***

**Tip:** You can further refine your .md appearance with custom CSS if your platform supports it. However, following this outline ensures a clean, Perplexity-like experience with plain Markdown.[3][1][2]

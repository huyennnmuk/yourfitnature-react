## Introduction

Write a strong introduction here to hook the reader.

## Table of Contents

1. [Intro](#introduction)
2. [Main Section](#main-section-title)

## Main Section Title

Your main content goes here. Use headings (##, ###), short paragraphs, and visuals to break up the text.

### Subsection Example

- Bullet points for lists
- Easy-to-scan information

> Use blockquotes for highlighting key points, quotes, or notes to readers.

### Add Images or Rich Media

Short bio about the writer. Optionally include social/profile links.

### Key Layout and Formatting Tips

- Use YAML frontmatter for metadata: title, date, author, tags, summary.
- Start with a **#-level headingor the post title.
- Display the cover image after the title, followed by author/date.
- Separate sections using `##` and `###` to organize content.
- Insert a **Table of Contents** (optional, but useful for long posts).
- Use lists, blockquotes, images, and code blocks to enrich content.
- End posts with related links, a conclusion, and author bio.
- Use horizontal rules (---) for clear separation.

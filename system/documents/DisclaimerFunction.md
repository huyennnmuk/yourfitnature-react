## Disclaimer Function for a Gut Affiliate Website  
**For: Single Blog Post Page & Single Product Page**

***

### **Purpose**
A disclaimer function ensures legal compliance, transparency, and user trust by clearly notifying visitors about affiliate relationships whenever a post or product contains monetized links or promoted content.[1][2][3]

***

### **Recommended Placement**

- **Single Blog Post Page:**  
  - Ideally, directly *under the title* or *above the first paragraph* for maximum visibility before affiliate links appear.[4][5][6][7]
  - Optional: Also repeat at the bottom of the post if affiliates appear throughout lengthy content.

- **Single Product Page:**  
  - Position prominently *above product details* or near/above any “Buy/Shop” call-to-action buttons to inform before purchase intent.[8]

***

### **Display Style**
- Visually distinguishable box, banner, or callout (e.g., contrasting background, icon).[5][7][1]
- Use simple, clear language—avoid legal jargon.[2][3][9][10]
- Supports different templates (short inline vs. full detailed, link to main disclosure page if desired).[3][9][10]
- Accessible font and color, respects mobile display.

***

### **Example Disclaimer Texts**  
**Short, General:**  
> “This post contains affiliate links. If you click and make a purchase, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.”[9][10][2]

**For Product Pages:**  
> “Some links on this page are affiliate links. We earn from qualifying purchases, helping support this site—thank you!”[10][8]

**Amazon Example:**  
> “As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.”[11]

**Extended:**  
> “We only recommend products and services we trust. Some links in this post are affiliate links, which means we may receive a commission if you purchase through them. This comes at no additional cost to you. Learn more in our full disclaimer.”[3][9][10]

***

### **Implementation Best Practices**
- Add automatically to all posts or product pages with affiliate links (via shortcode, widget, or block editor for WordPress; conditionally by category or tag if possible).[12][1][11]
- For manual insertion, provide a simple snippet or toggle in the post/product edit panel.
- Allow admin editing or template selection (e.g., general vs. program-specific).
- Optionally, link to a full affiliate disclosure page for more details.[2][5][3]

***

### **Legal Compliance**
- Meets FTC and affiliate program rules: must be “clear & conspicuous,” in plain language, and appear before affiliate links or strong purchase recommendations.[13][10][2][3]
- Not buried at the bottom, not hidden in terms—visible on every relevant page.

### **Summary Table: Blog vs Product Page**

| Location           | Where to Display                           | Sample Text / Note                                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Blog Post Page     | Top (below title), maybe also at bottom    | “This post contains affiliate links. We may earn a commission…”              |
| Product Page       | Above product info or CTA button           | “Some links on this page are affiliate links…”                               |
| Footer/Sitewide    | Less effective, only as supplement         | “Learn more: Full affiliate policy” (links to main disclosure page)          |

***

**Key Principle:**  
Be *upfront, brief, and transparent*—helping users make informed decisions and ensuring your site remains trusted and legally compliant.[1][9][10][2][3]

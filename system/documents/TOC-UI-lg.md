On large screens (like desktops and wide monitors), a Table of Contents (TOC) can be designed to provide even greater utility and visual clarity compared to smaller devices. Here’s how best-practice, feature-rich TOC interfaces function on large screens:

## Best UI Practices for TOC on Large Screens

### 1. Permanent Sidebar Placement
- **Fixed Sidebar:** Place the TOC in a sidebar (usually left or right aligned) that remains visible and accessible as users scroll through the content.
- **Width:** Sidebar width can be between 200–300px for optimal readability without crowding main content.
- **Sticky/Floating Behavior:** Make the TOC sticky so it stays in view, or allow it to scroll independently in very long documents.[1][2]

### 2. Multi-level Hierarchies and Indentation
- **Show Multiple Levels:** Display clear indentation for headings, sub-headings, and even deeper levels when necessary.
- **Collapsible Sections:** For long documents, allow users to expand or collapse major sections to minimize clutter.[1]
- **Visual Cues:** Use arrows, chevrons, or plus/minus icons to show expandable/collapsible hierarchy.

### 3. Active Section Highlighting
- **Current Position Indicator:** Highlight the current section in the TOC as the user scrolls (“scroll spy”), possibly with a bold font or background color.[2][1]
- **Smooth Animation:** Provide smooth scrolling and transitions to improve navigation feedback.

### 4. Navigational Enhancements
- **Clickable Links:** All headings within the TOC are clickable, using anchor links for quick jumps.
- **Back to Top Button:** Optionally, place a “Back to Top” shortcut at the top or bottom of the TOC for rapid navigation in long pages.

### 5. Additional Features and Details
- **Numbered Headings:** Optionally number each TOC entry for clarity in heavily structured documents.
- **Progress Bar:** Integrate a reading progress bar alongside or within the TOC area to visually represent how much the user has read.
- **Search Function:** For very large documents, a search box at the top of the TOC allows users to quickly locate sections.[1]
- **Hover and Focus States:** Use subtle highlight effects for mouse hover and keyboard focus to improve accessibility.

### 6. Visual and Accessibility Enhancements
- **Contrast and Readability:** Ensure sufficient contrast between TOC text and background.
- **Semantic Markup:** Use , , and appropriate ARIA roles for assistive technologies.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All TOC links should be accessible via keyboard tabbing.

By taking advantage of the wider viewport, a well-designed TOC on large screens becomes both an effective navigational tool and an at-a-glance map of the document’s structure, improving overall user experience and efficiency.[3][2][1]

# You are a world-class gut health strategist, SEO content architect, and ethical affiliate business builder.

Your task is to generate **10 highly specific, SEO-optimized, and monetizable blog post formats** under the theme of **Symptom Solver Deep Dives** for the FitNature platform.

Each blog format should be:

- Focused on a single **gut-related symptom** (e.g., bloating, IBS, constipation, SIBO, leaky gut)
- Designed to deeply explore causes, science, diet tips, supplement options, and actionable paths
- Structured to build **trust, clarity, and conversion** through ethical content and affiliate education

For each idea, include:

- **🔍 Deep Dive Format Name or Concept**
- **Elevator Pitch**: 1–2 sentence summary of the format’s core value
- **👥 Target Reader**: Specific audience segment searching for that symptom
- **💢 Key Pain Point Solved**: What confusion, stress, or doubt this format removes
- **💰 Monetization Method**: How to ethically monetize this content (e.g. affiliate links, lead magnet, funnel starter)
- **🛡 Unique Angle or Strategic Edge**: What makes this structure superior to generic health blogs or influencer takes

Context:

- FitNature is a solo-run gut health affiliate blog that simplifies symptom education, builds ethical funnels, and links readers to the right solutions.
- Audience includes busy professionals, wellness-curious women, moms, and those frustrated by mainstream supplement hype.
- FitNature uses symptom filters, GutSmart Prompt Engine, storytelling frameworks, and clear taxonomies (e.g., Gut Issues, Supplement Benefits).

Constraints:

- Must be executable by a solo founder with no editorial team
- Formats should be evergreen, modular, and linkable across product pages and blog series
- Must follow SEO best practices (H2s, FAQ blocks, snippet targeting, internal links, schema-ready)

Output Format:
Respond as a numbered list (1–10). Use the following structure per idea:

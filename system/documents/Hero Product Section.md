**PRD: Hero Product Section — Luminous Labs Essential Page**

  - Sits at the very top of the page, fully visible on landing.
  - Pushed below a minimalist, sticky navigation menu (with logo, shop, company, technology, cart, etc.).

- **Main Columns/Blocks:**  
  - **Left (or top on mobile):** Large high-quality product photo.
  - **Right (or below on mobile):** Product content and CTAs.

    - Warranty (e.g., “8-Year Warranty”)
    - Payment (Klarna, PayPal, Visa)
    - Delivery (“Fast, free shipping”)
    - Certification (e.g., CE, RohS)

    - Deep Rest
    - Skin Health
    - Happy Gut
    - Brain Boost

- **Visual/Background:**
  - Neutral/white background to focus attention on product and content.

## Slide 3: Luteal Phase Biology - The Real Story

**LUTEAL PHASE REALITY CHECK**

**Days 15-28: The Preparation Phase**

**HORMONAL SHIFTS:**
• Estrogen: Dramatic drop after ovulation
• Progesterone: Rise then fall (if no pregnancy)
• Serotonin: Decreases with estrogen
• Cortisol sensitivity: Increases

**BODY CHANGES:**
• Water retention increases
• Digestive motility slows
• Inflammation markers rise
• Blood sugar stability decreases
• Sleep patterns often disrupted

**WHY BLOATING GETS STUBBORN:**
Progesterone relaxes smooth muscle → slower digestion + water retention + inflammation = the "PMS bloat trifecta"

## Slide 4: The PMS Bloating Spectrum

**YOUR PMS BLOATING IS VALID**

**THE SPECTRUM OF NORMAL:**
🟢 **MILD:** Slight fullness, clothes feel snug
🟡 **MODERATE:** Noticeable discomfort, need looser clothes
🟠 **SIGNIFICANT:** Painful bloating, impacts daily activities
🔴 **SEVERE:** Extreme discomfort, debilitating symptoms

**COMMON PATTERNS:**
• Early luteal: Gradual building (days 15-21)
• Late luteal: Peak intensity (days 22-28)
• Location varies: upper belly, lower abdomen, all over
• Timing varies: morning, evening, after meals, constant

**WHAT MAKES IT WORSE:**
• High stress periods
• Irregular eating patterns  
• Lack of sleep
• Dehydration
• Certain foods (varies by person)

**YOU'RE NOT IMAGINING IT:** Studies show luteal bloating can increase waist circumference by 1-4 inches

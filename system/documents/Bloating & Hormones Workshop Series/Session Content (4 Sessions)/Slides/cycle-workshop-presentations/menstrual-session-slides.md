## Slide 3: Menstrual Phase Biology - The Wisdom of Rest

**THE BIOLOGY OF SACRED REST**

**Days 1-7: Your Body's Monthly Reset**

**HORMONAL LANDSCAPE:**
• All reproductive hormones at lowest levels
• Cortisol sensitivity decreased (natural calm)
• Brain hemispheres communicate differently
• Natural introspection and clarity enhanced

**BODY'S REST AGENDA:**
• Uterine lining renewal process
• Inflammation naturally decreasing
• Iron levels may be lower (fatigue makes sense)
• Digestive system often more sensitive
• Energy reserves rebuilding for next cycle

**THE GIFT OF LOW HORMONES:**
• Enhanced ability to see what's not working
• Clearer boundaries and authentic priorities
• Natural slowing allows for deep rest
• Preparation for the fresh start coming

**PERIOD BLOATING FACTORS:**
Prostaglandins + digestive sensitivity + lower energy = need for extra gentleness

## Slide 4: Period Bloating vs. Other Cycle Bloating

**UNDERSTANDING PERIOD BLOATING**

**HOW IT'S DIFFERENT:**
🩸 Lower abdomen focus (uterine area)
🌊 Often comes in waves with cramps
🔄 Changes throughout flow (heaviest = most bloating)
😴 Combined with fatigue (harder to "push through")
🤸‍♀️ Less responsive to high-intensity movement

**TYPICAL PATTERNS:**
• Day 1-2: Often most intense
• Day 3-4: May improve as flow lightens  
• Day 5-7: Gradual resolution as period ends
• Individual variation is completely normal

**WHAT MAKES IT WORSE:**
• Dehydration (when you're losing fluids)
• High salt intake (increases water retention)
• Stress about the symptoms
• Trying to maintain normal intensity/pace
• Tight clothing around waist

**WHAT ACTUALLY HELPS:**
✓ Heat therapy (heating pads, warm baths)
✓ Gentle, flowing movement
✓ Anti-inflammatory foods and drinks
✓ Adequate rest and sleep
✓ Comfortable, loose clothing

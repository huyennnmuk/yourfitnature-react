## Slide 4: The "Ovary Bloat" Phenomenon

**UNDERSTANDING MID-CYCLE BLOATING**

**OVARY BLOAT BASICS:**
• Sharp, localized sensations around ovaries
• Temporary fullness or swelling
• Often one-sided (alternates monthly)
• Typically lasts 24-48 hours around ovulation

**WHY IT HAPPENS:**
• Follicle growth stretches ovary
• Fluid release during ovulation
• Hormone shifts affect digestion
• Peak energy can mask early signals

**NORMAL PATTERNS:**
✓ Comes and goes with ovulation
✓ Manageable with gentle interventions
✓ Doesn't interfere with daily activities

**WHEN TO INVESTIGATE:**
❌ Severe pain that doubles you over
❌ Lasts more than 3-4 days
❌ Gets progressively worse each cycle

🥑 Healthy fats for hormone production

**PEAK PHASE TIMING:**

• Post-activity protein within 2 hours
• Consistent meal timing prevents energy crashes

**ANTI-BLOAT STRATEGIES:**
✓ Digestive enzymes with larger meals
✓ Ginger tea or fresh ginger with meals

✓ Stay ahead of hydration needs

Extra B vitamins, magnesium, and electrolytes

## Slide 7: Movement That Matches Your Energy

**PEAK PHASE MOVEMENT: Go for It (Smartly)**

**MAXIMIZE YOUR NATURAL HIGH:**
💪 Strength training - you're at peak power
🏃‍♀️ High-intensity cardio - if it feels good
🧘‍♀️ Dynamic yoga or Pilates
🏊‍♀️ Swimming laps vs. gentle floating
🎾 Sports, dancing, challenging activities

**OVULATION MOVEMENT RULES:**
• Your body can handle more - listen to that
• Recovery is still important - don't skip it
• Perfect time for new challenges or PRs
• Social exercise often appeals more now

**BLOAT-BUSTING MOVEMENT:**
• 5-10 minutes walking after meals
• Gentle twisting poses if feeling full
• Core engagement (but avoid crunching if bloated)
• Movement helps hormone and digestion flow

**WARNING SIGNS TO BACK OFF:**
Sharp ovarian pain during activity, unusual fatigue, digestive distress that worsens with movement

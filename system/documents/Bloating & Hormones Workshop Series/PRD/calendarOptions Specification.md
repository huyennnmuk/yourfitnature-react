# calendarOptions Specification

## Overview

The `calendarOptions` constant in `CalendarIntegrationSection.tsx` defines the available calendar platforms users can add events to. It is used to dynamically render a list of calendar integration options in the UI.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Definition

- `calendarOptions` is an array of objects.
- Each object represents a calendar platform integration option.

### 2. Object Structure

Each object in the array must have the following properties:
- `name` (string): The display name of the calendar platform (e.g., "Google Calendar").
- `icon` (React component): The icon component to visually represent the platform (e.g., `Globe`, `Mail`).
- `platform` (string): A unique identifier for the platform, used for analytics and logic (e.g., "google", "outlook").

### 3. Supported Platforms

The array must include, at minimum, the following platforms:
- Google Calendar
- Outlook
- Apple Calendar
- Yahoo Calendar

### 4. Usage

- The array is mapped over to render clickable options in the dropdown menu.
- Each option must display:
  - The platform icon.
  - The platform name.
  - An external link icon.
- Clicking an option triggers the `handleCalendarClick(platform)` function, passing the `platform` string.

### 5. Extensibility

- The structure should allow easy addition or removal of platforms by editing the array.
- Each new platform must follow the same object structure.

### 6. Type Safety

- The array should be typed (using TypeScript) to ensure each object contains the required properties.

## Example

```tsx
const calendarOptions = [
  { name: 'Google Calendar', icon: Globe, platform: 'google' },
  { name: 'Outlook', icon: Mail, platform: 'outlook' },
  { name: 'Apple Calendar', icon: Smartphone, platform: 'apple' },
  { name: 'Yahoo Calendar', icon: Globe, platform: 'yahoo' },
];
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The array should be defined outside of render loops to avoid unnecessary re-creation.
- **Maintainability:** The structure should be clear and documented for future developers.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- All required platforms are present and rendered correctly.
- Clicking an option triggers the correct analytics and logic.
- Adding a new platform requires only adding a new object to the array.
- TypeScript enforces the correct structure

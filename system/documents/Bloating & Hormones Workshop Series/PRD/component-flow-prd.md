## User Stories & Journey Mapping

### Primary User Persona: "Workshop Journey Sarah"
**Journey Stages & Pain Points:**

#### Discovery Stage (Entry → Landing Page)
- **As a user arriving from a quiz result**, I want to see content that acknowledges my specific bloating concerns so I feel this workshop is relevant to me
- **As a mobile user**, I want landing page buttons to be easily tappable and load quickly so I don't abandon due to poor mobile experience
- **As a privacy-conscious person**, I want clear assurance about the faceless format before I commit to registering

#### Decision Stage (Landing Page → Registration)
- **As someone comparing workshop phases**, I want to easily understand differences between sessions and select the most relevant one for my needs
- **As a busy person**, I want registration to be quick (2-3 fields max) without unnecessary complexity
- **As someone skeptical of health programs**, I want transparent information about what happens after registration

#### Preparation Stage (Confirmation → Workshop Ready)
- **As a new registrant**, I want immediate confirmation that my registration worked and clear information about what happens next
- **As someone who might forget**, I want easy calendar integration that works with my preferred calendar app
- **As a prepared learner**, I want access to pre-workshop materials that help me get the most value from the session

#### Experience Stage (Workshop Participation)
- **As someone who missed the live session**, I want easy access to the replay without having to re-register or jump through hoops
- **As a mobile user**, I want workshop materials and replay to work seamlessly on my phone
- **As an engaged participant**, I want clear pathways to additional resources and next steps

#### Continuation Stage (Replay → Next Actions)
- **As someone who found value in the workshop**, I want obvious options for continuing my learning journey
- **As someone interested in products**, I want honest, non-pushy recommendations with clear affiliate disclosure
- **As a community-minded person**, I want opportunities to connect with others on similar journeys

## Component Flow Strategy

### Flow Architecture Overview

```
Traffic Sources → Landing Page → Registration → Confirmation → Workshop → Replay → Next Actions
      ↓              ↓             ↓             ↓            ↓         ↓          ↓
  [Quiz/Blog]    [Registration]  [Form Submit] [Preparation] [Live/Miss] [Resources] [Upsells]
  [Social/Email] [Phase Select]  [Validation]  [Calendar]    [Q&A]       [Downloads] [Community]
  [Referrals]    [Trust Build]   [Analytics]   [Downloads]   [Analytics] [Analytics] [Lifecycle]
```

### Button Interaction Hierarchy

#### Primary Action Buttons (Conversion-Critical)
1. **"Register Free"** (Landing Page Hero)
   - **Purpose:** Primary conversion action
   - **Placement:** Above fold, repeated 3-4 times down page
   - **Analytics:** Track with highest priority, A/B test continuously
   - **Success State:** Redirects to confirmation page with session data

2. **"Add to Calendar"** (Confirmation Page)
   - **Purpose:** Reduce no-shows through calendar integration
   - **Placement:** Prominent in confirmation hero section
   - **Analytics:** Track platform preferences and success rates
   - **Success State:** Calendar event added, user sees confirmation

3. **"Watch Replay"** (Replay Page Access)
   - **Purpose:** Content consumption and engagement
   - **Placement:** Hero section of replay page
   - **Analytics:** Track viewing duration and completion rates
   - **Success State:** Video plays, chapters accessible

#### Secondary Action Buttons (Engagement & Progression)
1. **Phase Selection Buttons** (Landing Page)
   - **Purpose:** Personalization and relevance matching
   - **Logic:** Allow single or multiple session selection
   - **Analytics:** Track preference patterns and conversion by phase

2. **Download Resource Buttons** (Confirmation & Replay)
   - **Purpose:** Immediate value delivery and engagement
   - **Logic:** Token-based access, track download completion
   - **Analytics:** Monitor which resources drive highest engagement

3. **Next Step Action Buttons** (Replay Page)
   - **Purpose:** Lifecycle progression and monetization
   - **Logic:** Context-aware recommendations based on completed session
   - **Analytics:** Track progression rates to each next action type

### Cross-Component State Management

#### User Context Preservation
**Data Points Maintained Across Components:**
- Registration source (quiz, blog, social, etc.)
- Selected workshop phase(s)
- Email and basic profile information
- Download history and engagement metrics
- Calendar integration status
- UTM parameters and attribution data

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Browser localStorage for session persistence
- Secure tokens for page-to-page authentication
- Backend API for permanent state storage
- Cookie-based returning user recognition

#### Progressive Data Collection
**Landing Page:** Email, name, session preference
**Confirmation Page:** Calendar platform, resource downloads, community opt-ins
**Replay Page:** Viewing behavior, resource usage, next action selections

## Technical Requirements

### Button Behavior Standards

#### Universal Button States
1. **Default State:** Clear call-to-action text, branded styling
2. **Hover State:** Visual feedback (color change, shadow, animation)
3. **Loading State:** Spinner animation, "Processing..." text
4. **Success State:** Green checkmark, confirmation message (2-3 seconds)
5. **Error State:** Red warning, "Try Again" option with retry logic

#### Mobile Optimization Requirements
- Minimum touch target: 44px × 44px
- Thumb-friendly spacing: 8px minimum between buttons
- Fast tap response: <100ms visual feedback
- Touch gesture support where appropriate

### Analytics Integration

#### Button-Level Tracking
Every button interaction must fire:
```javascript
gtag('event', 'button_click', {
  'button_id': buttonElement.id,
  'button_text': buttonElement.textContent,
  'component_name': getCurrentComponent(),
  'user_session_id': getUserSessionId(),
  'click_sequence': getClickSequence()
});
```

#### Cross-Component Journey Tracking
```javascript
gtag('event', 'component_transition', {
  'from_component': previousComponent,
  'to_component': currentComponent,
  'transition_trigger': triggerType,
  'user_progression_stage': getProgressionStage()
});
```

### Error Handling & Fallbacks

#### Component-Level Error Recovery
1. **Network Failures:** Retry logic with exponential backoff
2. **Invalid States:** Redirect to safe fallback page (usually landing page)
3. **Missing Data:** Graceful degradation with alternative flows
4. **Mobile Issues:** Progressive enhancement with core functionality preserved

#### User Communication Strategy
- Clear, non-technical error messages
- Always provide alternative action options
- Include support contact for persistent issues
- Maintain user context even during error recovery

## Conversion Optimization Strategy

### A/B Testing Framework

#### Landing Page Optimization
- **Hero CTA variations:** Button text, color, placement
- **Session selection:** Single vs. multiple phase options
- **Trust signals:** Different social proof approaches

#### Confirmation Page Optimization
- **Calendar integration:** Primary vs. dropdown approach
- **Resource presentation:** Grid vs. list vs. carousel
- **Next steps:** Immediate vs. delayed cross-sell presentation

#### Replay Page Optimization
- **Video presentation:** Autoplay vs. manual start
- **Resource access:** Immediate vs. gated behind email
- **Progression CTAs:** Single strong vs. multiple option approach

### Personalization Rules

```javascript
const personalizationRules = {
  quiz: {
    landingPageHero: "Based on your assessment results...",
    confirmationMessage: "Your personalized workshop is ready...",
    replayRecommendations: "Continue your assessment-based journey..."
  },
  blog: {
    landingPageHero: "Dive deeper into cycle-synced solutions...",
    confirmationMessage: "Thank you for joining from our blog...",
    replayRecommendations: "Explore more articles and resources..."
  }
};
```

#### Progressive Enhancement
- First-time visitors: Basic information and trust building

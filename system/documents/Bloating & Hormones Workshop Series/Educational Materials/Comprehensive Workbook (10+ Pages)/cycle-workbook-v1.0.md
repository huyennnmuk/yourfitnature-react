## Your Cycle Overview

**UNDERSTANDING YOUR PHASES**

<!-- figure alt: "A simple 4-phase circular diagram showing Follicular (Days 1-7), Ovulatory (Days 8-14), Luteal (Days 15-28), and Menstrual (Days 28/1-7) phases with arrows indicating cycle flow" -->

Your menstrual cycle is typically around 28 days (though it varies person to person). It's divided into four phases, each with distinct hormonal shifts. Here's what happens in each phase and how it might affect bloating:

### **MENSTRUAL PHASE (Days 1-7)**
✓ **What's happening:** Period begins, hormone levels at lowest, body sheds uterine lining  
✓ **Common symptoms:** Cramps, fatigue, low energy, possible bloating relief as bleeding starts  
✓ **Focus:** Warm, nourishing foods + gentle movement + extra rest

### **FOLLICULAR PHASE (Days 8-13)**
✓ **What's happening:** Estrogen steadily rises, body prepares egg for ovulation  
✓ **Common symptoms:** Improving mood, increasing energy, minimal bloating  
✓ **Focus:** Lean proteins + complex carbs + increased activity

### **OVULATORY PHASE (Days 14-15)**
✓ **What's happening:** Ovary releases egg, estrogen peaks, slight temperature rise  
✓ **Common symptoms:** Peak energy, confidence high, possible mild ovulation twinge  
✓ **Focus:** Fresh, light meals + high-intensity movement (if desired)

### **LUTEAL PHASE (Days 16-28)**
✓ **What's happening:** Progesterone dominates, can slow digestion  
✓ **Common symptoms:** PMS (bloating, cravings, mood swings), water retention  
✓ **Focus:** Complex carbs + magnesium-rich foods + stress management

> **Remember:** Every body is unique. These are starting points, not rules!

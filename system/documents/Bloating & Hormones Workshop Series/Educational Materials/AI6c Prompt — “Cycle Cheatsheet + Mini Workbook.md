# AI6c Prompt ‚Äî ‚ÄúCycle Cheatsheet + Mini Workbook (Markdown outputs)‚Äù

1) Task
Generate two production-ready Markdown documents to be converted to PDFs for the FitNature ‚ÄúBloating \& Hormones Workshop Series‚Äù:
cycle-cheatsheet.md (1 page, B/W, printer-friendly)
mini-workbook.md (6‚Äì10 pages equivalent, B/W + grayscale accents only)
Both must comply with: structure \& content scope, print design constraints, accessibility, metadata/identifiers, and versioning guidelines.
2) Context
Audience: workshop participants tracking cycle-linked bloating; materials must be faceless, easy to print at home, readable on mobile, and accessible (screen-reader friendly, logical headings, alt text on figures).
Cheatsheet: a single-page quick reference with 4 phases √ó concise protocols table; pure B/W, safe margins, high contrast, no bleed.
Mini Workbook: cover, how-to, phase overview, daily/weekly logs, protocol tracker, reflections, resources/next steps; keep forms/checklists clear and taggable.
File constraints \& IDs: include YAML-style metadata (title, author, subject, keywords, version, dates, language); keep output lean (optimize images later), and use semantic versioning in the files (e.g., v1.0.0).
3) Exemplars (incorporate \& adapt, not verbatim)
Cheatsheet main grid (4 phases: Follicular, Ovulatory, Luteal, Menstrual) with columns for Days, Typical Symptoms, Food Focus, Movement/Self-Care, Quick SOS Protocol.
Workbook sections: Cover, How to Use, Cycle Overview (simple 4-phase wheel caption), Daily Tracking Grids (1‚Äì5 scales, checkboxes), Weekly Reflections (guided prompts), Protocol Success Tracker, Resources \& Next Steps, Disclaimer.
4) Persona
Act as: (a) Instructional designer, (b) PDF/accessibility specialist (WCAG 2.1 AA mindset), (c) FitNature brand editor ensuring evidence-based, non-medical-advice language and inclusive tone.
5) Format
Output exactly two fenced code blocks (no extra commentary inside them):
Block 1: cycle-cheatsheet.md
Must include:
Front matter (YAML) with: title, subtitle, version: v1.0.0, author: FitNature, subject, keywords, created, modified, language: en-US, doc\_id: CCS-v1.0.0.
H1 title and a short strapline; printer-friendly note (B/W only).
One grid/table (4 rows = phases; columns: Days, Typical Symptoms, Food Focus, Movement/Self-Care, Quick SOS). Keep bullets ultra-concise; avoid color; borders as plain Markdown table.
Footer with educational disclaimer, privacy line, and a placeholder [QR code/URL: Full Workbook].
Accessibility notes in comments (e.g., <!-- figure alt: ... -->) for any icons or figures.
Safe margins guidance (as comments) and no bleed.
Block 2: mini-workbook.md
Must include:
Front matter (YAML) with metadata mirroring Cheatsheet, doc\_id: MWB-v1.0.0, and toc: true.
Sections (H2):
Cover (title, subtitle, fields for Name/Date/Session);
How to Use (Step-by-step + table of contents);
Cycle Overview (brief phase snapshots + a placeholder figure with alt text for a 4-phase wheel);
Daily Tracking Grids (repeatable block with 1‚Äì5 symptom scales, hydration, sleep, stress, movement, protocols tried, ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs win,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat didn‚Äôt work,‚Äù ‚ÄúTomorrow I‚Äôll try‚Äù);
Weekly Reflection Prompts (Week 1‚Äì4 with progressive depth);
Protocol Success Tracker (Food / Movement / Lifestyle tables with Tried? Helpful? Notes columns);
Resources \& Next Steps;
Legal Disclaimer + Privacy note.
(Use checkboxes - [ ], emoji scales where helpful, and short sentences for readability.)
Accessibility \& structure: proper H1/H2/H3 hierarchy, descriptive link text, alt text for any figures, simple language, and logical reading order; keep content B/W/high-contrast friendly.
Print/usability constraints: generous spacing for handwriting; keep tables from splitting awkwardly (note as comment for layout stage); no background colors or gradients.
Shared acceptance criteria (apply to both blocks):
B/W only, high contrast, no color-dependent meaning; printer-friendly margins (note as comments).
Tagged/accessible intent captured via semantic Markdown (to be preserved when converted to tagged PDF/HTML); alt text for any figures; clear heading hierarchy.
Keep content concise, scannable; body text designed for \~11‚Äì12pt equivalent when rendered; avoid dense paragraphs.
Include Version \& History mini-table (date, change, reviewer) at the end of each file. Use semantic versioning (vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
6) Tone
Conversational yet professional, inclusive, action-oriented, non-judgmental, and empowerment-focused; strictly educational (not medical advice).

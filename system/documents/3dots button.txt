## What Exactly Shows in the Perplexity 3 Dots Button Tab

When you click the **three-dot (...) button** in Perplexity (usually located beside each answer or thread section), a contextual menu appears with several actionable options specific to that content. Based on the official help documentation and feature descriptions, the typical actions in this menu include:

- **View Sources**: Shows the sources used for the AIâ€™s response and lets you verify citations or click through to the original webpages.
- **Report Feedback**: Allows you to give feedback on the response (such as marking it as not helpful or flagging issues).
- **Delete**: Lets you remove that particular answer or thread portion from your view or your history.[1]

The menu may also surface additional context-specific actions such as:

- **Share**: Copy a link or share the thread/response with others.
- **Edit Query**: Change the question that generated the response.
- **Move to Space / Add Tag**: Organize the content into a workspace or apply categorization.

The set of options offered will be relevant to the item (thread, answer, response) where the three-dot menu is clicked, helping manage, organize, and interact with conversations and results efficiently.[1]

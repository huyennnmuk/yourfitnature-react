To align with the logic of the **Export** button on Perplexity.ai, your Export button should function as follows:

- When clicked, it opens a dropdown or dialog with export options (typically PDF, Markdown, or Plain Text).
- Users can choose which part of the page to export—usually the full answer, the current visible section, or a specific segment if they have navigated to one via the table of contents.
- Once an option is selected, the app generates the export file server-side or in-browser, preserving all formatting, code blocks, tables, and any interactive elements supported by the format.
- The resulting file is then downloaded automatically or through a save-file dialog, giving instant access to the exported content.
- On mobile and smaller screens, the export process remains responsive and accessible, with clear but compact menus/dialogs optimized for touch interaction.
- If the user is viewing a filtered or focused section (e.g., via TOC jumps or active filters), only that content is included in the export, matching Perplexity’s context-sensitive export function.
- This logic ensures that users retain an export reflecting exactly what they are seeing, in their chosen format, with minimal steps.

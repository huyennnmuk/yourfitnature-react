# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Perplexity "Copy" Button

## Purpose
Enable users to easily copy text, tables, or code from Perplexity AI outputs for use in other applications while preserving formatting and streamlining workflow.[1][2][3]

## Problem Statement
Current methods require manually highlighting content or using keyboard shortcuts, leading to inconsistent formatting and user frustration, especially with tables, code snippets, or content with citations. Users experience copy-paste issues in various browsers and platforms.[2][3][4][5][1]

## Functional Requirements

- **Button Placement**
  - Located adjacent to generated content blocks (e.g., answers, tables, code).[3][5]
  - Clearly labeled "Copy" with standard clipboard icon.

- **Supported Content Types**
  - Text, tables (Markdown, HTML as rendered), and code blocks.[5]
  - Handles single or multi-format (mixed text/table/code) selection.

- **Formatting Preservation**
  - Copy retains original Markdown or HTML formatting for tables and code blocks where applicable.[4][1][2]
  - Option to "Copy as Plain Text" for formatting-free paste.

- **Citation Handling**
  - Option to copy with or without citation numbers and links.[6][4]
  - Default: copy as displayed; advanced: strip citations on-demand with a toggle or settings option.

- **Browser & Platform Compatibility**
  - Works reliably across major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox).[2][5]
  - Clipboard API (or fallback method) for consistent copy action.

- **Feedback After Copy**
  - Show tooltip confirmation: “Copied!” with a transient indicator.
  - Optionally, notify of formatting issues if detected.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**
  - Copy action should be instantaneous (<500ms).

- **Accessibility**
  - Keyboard accessible (focusable, can trigger copy with Enter or Space).

- **Security**
  - Prevent script injection when copying code.

## User Stories

- **As a user,** I want to copy generated tables with one click so I can paste them directly into Google Sheets or Excel without losing formatting.[7][1][2]
- **As a developer,** I want to copy code blocks efficiently, preserving line breaks and indentation.[5]
- **As a writer,** I want to copy content without citation brackets or links for clean publishing.[4][6]

## Edge Cases & Troubleshooting

- Handle browser clipboard permission denial gracefully with instructions.
- Large content: Warn if copying could exceed OS clipboard size or cause unexpected behavior (e.g., creation of a "paste.txt" file for very large text).[8]

## Metrics for Success

- Increase in successful copy events per session.
- Reduction in support tickets for copy-paste issues.
- User satisfaction based on feedback surveys.

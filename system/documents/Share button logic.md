The functional behavior of the **Share** button on the "How table of content display on middle and small screen size with the best UI" page on Perplexity.ai is as follows:

- When you click the **Share** button, it typically opens a popover or modal with sharing options.
- The main options generally include copying a direct link to the current search or answer, and may also include easy-share buttons for social media platforms (such as Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn).
- Copying the link puts the page's unique URL onto your clipboard, so you can paste and share this exact answer anywhere.
- On smaller or mobile screens, the share popover or modal is usually designed to remain accessible and easy to close, ensuring seamless sharing without disrupting the mobile user experience.
- If you are not logged in, some share actions might prompt you to sign up or log in for advanced functionality, such as sharing via email or as a saved item.
- The shared link typically preserves your current viewâ€”if you have expanded or focused on a specific section, the copied link will reflect this state for the recipient.

This functional behavior is designed to facilitate **quick, easy sharing of insights and content**, regardless of device size, maintaining both usability and context.

## Perplexity FAQ-related Question UI Layout

The UI component for FAQ-related questions in Perplexity AI is designed for clarity, conversational ease, and seamless access to information. Here’s a breakdown of the typical layout and visual structure:

### Core Elements

- **Question & Answer Block:**  
  Each FAQ item begins with the question (usually in bold or as a header), immediately followed by a concise, direct answer. This mirrors how Perplexity presents core content for maximum readability and extraction.[1][2]

- **Follow-Up Questions:**  
  After the main answer, Perplexity suggests related or follow-up questions. These are styled as clickable buttons or links beneath the answer block, helping users explore tangential topics without leaving the current conversation.[2][1]

- **Citations Panel:**  
  Answers include inline numbered citations (e.g., , ), linking to sources. In research views, a dedicated panel or tab lists source details for easy verification and deeper exploration.[3][4][2]

- **Expandable Answers:**  
  For complex topics, the FAQ block may be collapsible/expandable. Short answers appear first, with a “Show More” link revealing deeper details, formatting such as bullet points, lists, or tables for clarity.[1]

- **Conversational UI:**  
  Follow-up queries can be asked directly in the input field at the bottom of the component, maintaining conversational flow. Suggested related FAQ items keep users engaged with contextually relevant next steps.[5][1]

### Typical Layout Structure (Markdown)

```markdown

| [Citations: 1, 2]                                   |
| [Show More]                                          |
| Related Questions: [What models does it use?] [How does research work?] |
```

### Visual Style & Usability Notes

- **Typography:** Clear, readable fonts, with questions in bold/headings.
- **Spacing:** Adequate whitespace between Q&A blocks for easy scanning.
- **Highlighting:** Inline citations in a different color (often blue) for visibility.
- **Interactions:** Clicking a related question loads the new FAQ, maintaining context.[2]
- **Sidebar (on desktop):** Frequently, there’s a sidebar listing related topics, prior queries, and suggestions for further exploration.[6]
- **Mobile Adaptation:** Collapsible/expandable FAQ blocks for efficient screen use.

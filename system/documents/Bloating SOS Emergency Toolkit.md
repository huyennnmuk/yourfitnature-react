### Evidence-based highlights

* Quick relief tips such as ginger tea (enzymes in ginger can help with bloating, ease constipation and nausea), taking a gentle walk to move gas, abdominal massage and over‑the‑counter simethicone to let gas pass (though research on its effectiveness is limited).
* Enteric‑coated peppermint oil eases bloating and abdominal pain in people with IBS, and stress‑reduction techniques like meditation and deep breathing are key.
* Fasting for a few hours allows the migrating motor complex to clear excess bacteria.
* The science snapshot explains that bloating is a feeling of tightness or fullness caused largely by intestinal gas produced when bacteria ferment carbohydrates; it notes triggers like swallowing air, carbonated drinks and high‑FODMAP foods.
* Red‑flag symptoms prompting medical evaluation include worsening or persistent bloating, pain, fever, vomiting, bleeding or weight loss.

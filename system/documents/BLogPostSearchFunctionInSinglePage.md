Got it ✅ — you specifically want a **PRD for a Blog Post Search function that is only inside a single, specific blog page**, not a global site-wide search.  
This scenario is common when the page contains **many posts or sections** (e.g., a "Knowledge Hub" or "Case Studies" page) and the user needs to search **only within that page’s posts**.  

Here’s the tailored PRD:  

***

## **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**  
### Feature: **Search Within a Single Blog Page**  

***

### **1. Overview**
The **In-Page Blog Search** function allows users to find specific posts or content snippets **within one designated blog page** (e.g., a category page, a special editorial page, or an author’s curated list).  
Unlike a full site search, this search is scoped to **only the blog entries loaded or listed on this page**.

***

### **2. Goals & Objectives**
- **Primary Goal:** Help users quickly locate relevant posts inside a long-form blog page or blog category landing page without leaving it.
- **Objectives:**
  - Improve navigation within a specific section.
  - Reduce scrolling fatigue.
  - Increase user engagement for that targeted content set.

***

### **3. Functional Requirements**

#### 3.1 Search Scope
- Filters **only** the blog posts displayed or linked on the current page.
- Does **not** search other categories, pages, or global site content.

#### 3.2 Search Bar UI
- Placement:
  - At the top of the blog posts list section for visibility.
- Placeholder text: `"Search posts in this page…"`
- Real-time filtering (optional enhancement):
  - As the user types, the post list updates instantly.
- Mobile friendly:
  - Collapsible search bar to save space on small screens.

#### 3.3 Search Logic
- Match against:
  - Post title
  - Post excerpt/summary
  - Post tags (if displayed on page)
- Partial and case-insensitive matching.
- Highlight matched text in titles/snippets (optional for better UX).

#### 3.4 Search Results Behavior
- The page dynamically filters the visible results (client-side search) without requiring full page reload.
- If using server-side filtering:
  - Page reloads with filtered post list after search submission.
- **No Results State:**
  - Show `"No posts found in this section. Try a different keyword."`
- Optionally, show the number of matching posts (e.g., “4 matches found”).

***

### **4. Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Performance:**
  - For client-side search: Filtering should happen in <100ms for up to 200 visible posts.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Search input labeled for screen readers.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:**
  - Works on all resolutions without breaking layout.
- **Scalability:**
  - For pages with large post counts, switch to server-side search for efficiency.

***

### **5. Technical Considerations**
- **Option 1: Client-Side Search (JS Filtering):**
  - Best if all posts are pre-loaded on the page.
  - Uses JavaScript to filter DOM elements by keyword.
- **Option 2: Server-Side Search:**
  - Triggered when the user submits the search query.
  - Blog page re-renders with filtered post list from DB query.
- Search index not needed if limited to loaded posts, but lightweight keyword matching logic is required.

***

### **6. User Stories**
1. **As a reader**, I want to search within the posts of this page so I can quickly find the one I’m interested in without visiting other sections.
2. **As a returning visitor**, I want my search results to show only the most relevant posts for this page’s topic so I don’t get unrelated content.
3. **As a mobile user**, I want the search experience to be smooth and not reload the whole site.

***

### **7. Success Metrics**
- Reduced average time spent scrolling before finding relevant content.
- Increased click-through rate to individual posts from the page.
- 90%+ of in-page searches return at least one relevant post.

***

### **8. Risks & Mitigation**
- **Risk:** Too many posts on a single page → client-side search performance drops.  
  *Mitigation:* Implement lazy load or switch to server-side search.  
- **Risk:** Users get confused about difference from site-wide search.  
  *Mitigation:* Clearly label: “Search in this page’s posts”.

***

### **9. Timeline**
| Phase | Task | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | UI/UX Design for in-page search | 3 days |
| 2 | Client-side filtering logic setup | 4 days |
| 3 | Responsive & Accessibility adjustments | 2 days |
| 4 | QA Testing | 2 days |
| 5 | Launch | 1 day |

If you want, I can also **include a minimal UX wireframe** to show exactly *where and how* this in-page search box should appear in relation to the blog posts list — making it much easier for your devs to implement.  

Do you want me to create that wireframe?

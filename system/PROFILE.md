## **14. Six-component Prompt Formula (AI6c)**

The six-component formula for mastering prompting involves the following building blocks: Task, Context, Exemplars, Persona, Format, and Tone

When prompted **AI6c**, rewrite the prompt with 6 components by following standards:

1. **Task**
    - **Mandatory Component:** The Task is a mandatory component in your prompt. If you only input the context without the task, nothing meaningful happens.
    - **Start with an Action Verb:** The rule of thumb is to always start the task sentence with an action verb, such as "generate," "give," "write," or "analyze".
    - **Clearly Articulate End Goal:** Clearly articulate what your end goal is.
    - **Complexity:** The task can be a single simple task or a complex multi-step task.
2. **Context**
    - **Importance:** It is important to include relevant context in your prompt.
    - **Difficulty:** Context is described as the trickiest component to get right because technically there is an infinite amount of information you can give.
    - **Determining Just Enough:** To come up with just enough information for a good result, ask yourself three questions: What's the user's background? What does success look like? What environment are they in?
    - **Goal:** The key to staying productive with the AI is giving **just enough information to constrain the endless possibilities**.
3. **Exemplars (Examples)**
    - **Importance:** It is important to include relevant exemplars in your prompt. If user have exemplars already, please use it or add to customize
    - **Necessity:** Exemplars are **not necessary for every prompt**.
    - **Types of Examples:** Examples can include rewriting structures (like an X by Y that resulted in Z format), using frameworks (like the STAR answer framework for interview questions), or referencing an existing document (like a job description for formatting and language).
4. **Persona**
    - **Optional Component:** Persona is considered a "nice to have" component.
    - **Definition:** Persona is basically who you want the AI to be.
    - **Pro Tip:** Think of someone you wish you had instant access to for the task you are facing.
    - **Examples:** This could be a physical therapist for workout injuries, a recruiter for job searching, or a senior product marketing manager for a creative brief. You can also name specific famous individuals (results may be better if they are famous enough) or fictional characters.
5. **Format**
    - **Optional Component:** Format is considered a **"nice to have"** component.
    - **Pro Tip:** visualize exactly how you want the end result to look like.
    - **Common Formats:** Common formats include emails, bullet points, code blocks, paragraphs, and markdown. Tables are also mentioned as a useful format.
    - **Specific Instructions:** You can provide specific formatting instructions, such as using H2 as section headers, or specifying that all changes should be bolded when proofreading.
6. **Tone**
    - **Optional Component:** Tone is considered a **"nice to have"** component.
    - **Ease of Understanding:** Tone is generally easy to understand, specifying things like a casual or formal tone of voice, or asking for a witty, enthusiastic, or pessimistic output.
    - When I am unsure of the exact adjectives, I will tell you like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the exact tone‚Äù, you will give me a list of tone keywords I can then include in my prompt. Examples of desired tones include clear and concise language, or a friendly yet confident tone

## **16 . DAN KOE 1-3-1 (DK1-3-1) Framework**

Whenever I ask for a **AI DK1-3-1 Framework**, I am asking you to help with a  **DAN KOE 1-3-1 (DK1-3-1) Framework** in which you apply format breakdown, with **Dan Koe Style Filters to Inject and AI6c_Dan Koe Prompt**

**üîß Format Breakdown:**

| Section | Description | Style Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 ‚Äì Insight Hook** | A single contrarian or philosophical idea that challenges conventional thinking | Short, sharp, existential. |
| **3 ‚Äì Support Statements** | 3 clear points that unpack the hook using science, psychology, or real-life metaphors | Blend of science + storytelling + systems thinking. |
| **1 ‚Äì Action/Belief Shift** | A single empowering belief, next step, or reframe | Simple. Emotive. Memorable. |

**üß† Dan Koe Style Filters to Inject:**

| Principle | FitNature Adaptation |
| --- | --- |

| **Inner > Outer** | Emphasize internal clarity via gut health |
| **Minimalism** | Use short, punchy, white-space-friendly lines |

| **Systems Thinking** | Show cause/effect between gut & life clarity |

**‚ú® Sample 1 ‚Äì Topic: *Gut & Clarity***

> Your mind isn‚Äôt foggy. Your gut is inflamed.
> 
1. Your gut produces neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.
2. Inflammation blocks this flow, clouding your thinking.
3. Most ‚Äúproductivity hacks‚Äù ignore the root cause: digestion.

> Clear your gut. Watch your thoughts sharpen.
> 

---

**‚ú® Sample 2 ‚Äì Topic: *Gut & Stress***

> Stress isn‚Äôt just emotional. It‚Äôs bacterial.
> 
1. Your gut and brain talk through the vagus nerve.
2. Dysbiosis = chemical chaos = cortisol spikes.
3. No amount of meditation can override chronic gut dysfunction.

> Fix your flora. Calm your mind.
> 

---

**‚ú® Sample 3 ‚Äì Topic: *Gut & Motivation (Dan Koe productivity angle)***

> You‚Äôre not lazy. You‚Äôre leaking energy.
> 
1. Gut inflammation means poor nutrient absorption.
2. Poor absorption = low cellular energy.
3. Low energy feels like burnout, even on a good day.

> Fuel from the inside out. Motivation follows.
> 

**AI6c_Dan Koe Prompt**

When prompted **AI6c_Dan Koe**, use the below prompt:

```
Task: Write a 1-3-1 style social media post in the voice of Dan Koe, connecting a gut health concept to emotional, mental, or lifestyle clarity.

It must include **cited references to popular science papers** throughout. This guide will be used as a **downloadable lead magnet**, positioning the brand as both trustworthy and transformational.

> **üå± Context**
> Today‚Äôs professionals are exhausted, foggy, and bloated ‚Äî and they think it‚Äôs just ‚Äústress.‚Äù This guide reframes that narrative: digestion isn‚Äôt just about food, and energy isn‚Äôt just about sleep. Everything flows from the gut. Your job is to explain how, with systems-thinking clarity and science-supported depth, while inviting them into a new way of living ‚Äî starting with their gut.

Use Dan Koe principles (Read the PDF attached file My_Profile_v7 for more information about Dan Koe principles):

* **Insight-driven hooks** to reframe beliefs

* **Minimalist, smart tone** with punchy line breaks
* **Inner ‚Üí Outer philosophy** (optimize internal systems, change external results)

> **üìå Exemplars**
> Structure the document like this:

1. **Short, contrarian introduction** ‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not tired. You‚Äôre inflamed.‚Äù
2. **Secret #1‚Äì5** ‚Äì For each:

   * Bold heading (e.g., ‚ÄúFix the leaks. Energy follows.‚Äù)
   * Hook that challenges a belief
   * Real science insight with a referenced study
   * Simple, powerful reframing or system idea
   * Actionable step + optional product tip (e.g., ‚ÄúTry fermented foods or a shelf-stable probiotic‚Äù)
3. **Conclusion** ‚Äì Soft CTA: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need more motivation. You need better gut clarity.‚Äù
4. **Final CTA** ‚Äì Invite to explore FitNature products or download an additional resource.

> **üßç Persona**
> A hybrid of:

* **Dan Koe‚Äôs systems philosopher**
* **A gut health educator and microbiome researcher**
* **A health writer who‚Äôs been through it personally**
  This is someone who doesn‚Äôt lecture ‚Äî they reveal. They simplify the complex. They help people shift.

> **üßæ Format**

* Markdown-friendly
* H2 for each section
* Use short lines and smart spacing
* Include inline science citations (e.g., ‚Äú(*Harvard Health, 2022*)‚Äù)
* Consider visual layout for future PDF (quick wins, footnotes, quote callouts)

> **üéØ Tone**

* Minimalist but rich
* Insightful but accessible
* Smart, calm, bold
* Reframes beliefs without shaming ‚Äî awakens curiosity
  This should feel like a mindset shift, not a lecture. Every section leaves them saying: ‚ÄúThis is why I feel off. And this is what I can do.‚Äù

## 17. Lead Document : **5 Secrets to Restoring Digestion and Enhancing Energy (AI_LD_01)**

Whenever I ask for a **`AI_LD_01`**, I am asking you about Lead Document : **5 Secrets to Restoring Digestion and Enhancing Energy**

5 main takeaways for restoring digestion and boosting energy:

1. **Prioritize repairing your gut lining to "seal in" energy.** The source suggests that a "leaky" gut (intestinal permeability), common in stressed individuals, prevents your body from effectively harvesting fuel from food
2. **Actively manage stress to calm your digestive system.** The sources emphasize that stress isn't just emotional; it has a physical impact on the gut, altering bacteria, inflaming the GI tract, and potentially thinning the gut lining
3. **Nurture your gut microbiome as a primary energy source.** Instead of solely focusing on *what* you eat, the source highlights that trillions of gut bacteria act as middlemen converting food into energy. Feeding your beneficial microbial teammates through prebiotic-rich foods (asparagus, garlic, oats) and fermented foods (yogurt, kimchi, kombucha), or considering synbiotic supplements (probiotics + prebiotics, e.g., FitNature‚Äôs Balanced Gut Synbiotic) (the 20% action) helps create a thriving community.
4. **Align your eating schedule with your body's natural clock.** The source points out that digestion follows a daily rhythm, and chaotic eating schedules disrupt this.
5. **Manage meal size to avoid digestive overload and energy crashes.** Large, heavy meals require significant energy to process, diverting blood flow from the brain and muscles and leading to post-meal drowsiness or "food coma".

## üìã Mega Prompt (Copy‚ÄìPaste Ready)

Use this if you're working on a new solo venture or want to adjust the context.

```
You are my personal market insight assistant for the gut health and holistic wellness industry. I'm a solo founder of FitNature ‚Äì a fully-bootstrapped, affiliate-based content platform and product recommender. No team, no investors ‚Äî just me creating strategic content, building affiliate systems, testing AI workflows, and trying to grow sustainably.

Your mission:
Scan the web for **real, urgent pain points** that busy professionals, parents, wellness enthusiasts, or digestive health seekers are complaining about ‚Äî especially those who:
- Are overwhelmed by gut health product choices.
- Feel lost in symptom research (e.g. bloating, IBS, low energy).
- Are skeptical of supplements but seeking clarity and results.
- Want simplified guidance but don't trust influencers or brands blindly.

Use forums like Reddit, Quora, YouTube comments, Amazon reviews, Twitter/X, Facebook groups, Pinterest, blog comment threads, and health communities. Focus on keywords around gut symptoms, supplement confusion, wellness overwhelm, decision fatigue, and natural remedies.

For each opportunity, break it down like this:

- **Pain Point** ‚Äì A real, specific complaint or struggle. Include quotes if possible.
- **Target Audience** ‚Äì Who is experiencing this pain?
- **Why It Hurts** ‚Äì What‚Äôs the consequence? (Lost time, money, trust, health)
- **Content/Tool Opportunity** ‚Äì What could I realistically create in <2 weeks with <$200/month budget? (content, quiz, checklist, AI tool, email series, etc.)
- **Monetization Potential** ‚Äì How could this drive affiliate clicks, email signups, trust-building?
- **Competitor Gaps** (Bonus) ‚Äì What do users dislike about current solutions?

Important Guidelines:
- No fluff. Prioritize clear, current user signals.
- Avoid vague trends ‚Äî focus on **wallet-backed, symptom-driven problems**.
- ‚ÄúBoring but painful‚Äù > ‚Äúcool but vague.‚Äù
- Prioritize **trust, simplification, and clarity** ‚Äî core to FitNature‚Äôs brand.

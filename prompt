## Instruction: Layout UI for Table of Contents (TOC)

Here’s a clear instruction for designing a UI layout for a Table of Contents (TOC) for a blog or documentation page such as "Startup Accounting: Everything You Need to Know":

***

### 1. **TOC Container**
- Position: Fixed or sticky on the left or right side of the main content (desktop); collapsible drawer or dropdown above content (mobile).
- Width: 220–300px for side placement.
- Spacing: Well-padded (e.g., 16px–24px inside) for readability.

### 2. **Header**
- Text: "Table of Contents" or "On this page"
- Style: Bold, slightly larger than section links (e.g., 18–20px)
- Optional icon: A list or summary icon for visual clarity.

### 3. **TOC Items (Sections)**
- Display: Vertical list of anchors/links to each section (e.g., H2/H3 anchors).
- Indentation: 
  - Level 1 (H2): Normal padding.
  - Level 2+ (H3, H4): Indented (e.g., 16px per level).
- Active item highlight: Distinct background, accent line, or bold/colored text represents the currently viewed section.
- Spacing: 8–12px between items.

### 4. **Link Functionality**
- Clickable: Every TOC item scrolls the main content smoothly to the matching heading.
- Accessibility: Use semantic elements (``, ``, ``, ``) for screen readers.
- Keyboard navigation: Allow tabbing and enter/space to activate links.

### 5. **Responsiveness**
- On screens <800px: Hide TOC by default; show behind a "Contents" button or dropdown.
- On screens ≥800px: Sticky/fixed sidebar remains visible as you scroll.

### 6. **Optional Enhancements**
- Collapsible subsections: Toggle nested TOC items for long content.
- Progress indicator: Visual cue alongside TOC showing scroll progress or section completion.
- Quick “Back to Top” link at top or bottom.

## Relevant Files

- `app/components/ResourcesPage.tsx` - The main React component that will be refactored to implement the new layout and styling.
- `app/components/ResourcesPage.test.tsx` - Unit and snapshot tests for the `ResourcesPage` component to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
- `app/globals.css` - Potential location for new global CSS styles for typography and layout, if not using CSS modules or Tailwind utility classes directly.
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS configuration may be referenced or modified to align with the new design system (e.g., spacing, colors).

### Notes

- Unit tests should be created or updated to reflect the new component structure and styling.
- Use `npx jest app/components/ResourcesPage.test.tsx` to run tests specifically for this component.
- Run `npx jest` to execute all tests and ensure no changes have caused regressions elsewhere in the application.

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Setup and Scaffolding
  - [x] 1.1 Create `app/components/ResourcesPage.test.tsx` if it does not already exist.
  - [x] 1.2 Add a baseline snapshot test of the existing component to capture its current structure before refactoring.
  - [x] 1.3 Identify the best location for new styles (e.g., a new CSS module, additions to `globals.css`, or purely through Tailwind utility classes).
- [x] 2.0 Refactor Component Layout for Single-Column Structure
  - [x] 2.1 Analyze the existing JSX in `ResourcesPage.tsx` to identify the root container and content sections.
  - [x] 2.2 Modify the JSX to ensure all page content renders within a single, top-level column.
  - [x] 2.3 Remove any legacy layout structures like multi-column grids or flexbox containers that are no longer needed.
- [x] 3.0 Apply Perplexity-Inspired Styling
  - [x] 3.1 Apply CSS (likely via Tailwind utility classes) to the main container to set a `max-width` and center it horizontally.
  - [x] 3.2 Use `margin` and `padding` utilities to create ample whitespace between sections, headings, and paragraphs.
  - [x] 3.3 Style `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc., to create a clear and consistent typographic hierarchy.
  - [x] 3.4 Style list (`ul`, `ol`) and table (`table`) elements to be clean and easily scannable.
  - [x] 3.5 Override or remove unnecessary `border`, `background-color`, and `box-shadow` styles to achieve a minimalist aesthetic.
- [x] 4.0 Ensure Mobile and Desktop Responsiveness
  - [x] 4.1 Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to adjust styles for different breakpoints.
  - [x] 4.2 Manually test the layout on various screen sizes, from small mobile to large desktop, to ensure a consistent and readable experience.
  - [x] 4.3 Verify that font sizes are legible and interactive elements are easily clickable on mobile devices.
- [ ] 5.0 Testing and Verification
  - [ ] 5.1 Update the component snapshot in `ResourcesPage.test.tsx` to match the new, refactored layout.
  - [ ] 5.2 Add a new test to confirm that the primary container has the correct CSS classes for the single-column layout.
  - [ ] 5.3 Manually review the page against the functional requirements in the PRD to ensure all criteria have been met.
  - [ ] 5.4 Run the full test suite (`npx jest`) to check for any regressions in other parts of the application.

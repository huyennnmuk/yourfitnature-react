### **Product Requirements Document: Single Product Page**

**1. Objective**

To create a dedicated product detail page that showcases a single product, providing users with comprehensive information and a clear path to purchase. This page will be crucial for converting user interest into sales by offering an engaging and informative experience.

**2. Scope**

This project involves the creation of a new page template for displaying individual products. The page will be accessible via a unique URL for each product (e.g., `yourfitnature.com/shop/product-name`).

**In Scope:**

*   **Dynamic Route:** Create a new dynamic route at `app/shop/[slug]/page.tsx`.
*   **Data Fetching:** Implement logic to fetch a single product's data based on the `slug` from the URL.
*   **Product Information Display:** The page must display the following information:
    *   Product Name
    *   Detailed Description
    *   Price
    *   High-quality images (gallery or carousel)
    *   Key benefits or ingredients
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** An "Add to Cart" button.
*   **Related Products:** A section to suggest other relevant products to the user.
*   **Styling:** The page must align with the existing brand and design guidelines as seen on the rest of the site.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Shopping cart functionality (this PRD only covers the display of the product).
*   Checkout and payment processing.
*   User reviews and ratings system.

**3. Functional Requirements**

*   **URL Structure:** The page should be accessible at `app/shop/[slug]`, where `[slug]` is the unique identifier for the product.
*   **Data Fetching:**
    *   A new function, `getProductBySlug(slug: string)`, should be created in `lib/getProducts.ts` to fetch the data for a single product.
    *   The page should handle cases where a product is not found and display an appropriate "Not Found" message or redirect.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   **Product Image Gallery:**
        *   Displays the product's images.
        *   Should allow the user to view multiple angles or variations of the product.
        *   A carousel or a main image with thumbnails is recommended.
    *   **Product Details Section:**
        *   **Title:** The product's full name.
        *   **Description:** A rich text description of the product.
        *   **Price:** Display the price clearly. If there are variants (e.g., different sizes), the price should update when a new variant is selected.
        *   **Quantity Selector:** A simple way for users to increase or decrease the quantity they wish to purchase.
        *   **Add to Cart Button:** A prominent button that, when clicked, would (in a future implementation) add the selected product and quantity to the user's cart. For now, it can be a placeholder.
    *   **Related Products Section:**
        *   At the bottom of the page, display a selection of 3-4 related products to encourage further browsing.
        *   This can be based on a category or other product attributes.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Performance:** The page must load quickly. All images should be optimized for the web to reduce load times without sacrificing quality.
*   **SEO:** The page's `<head>` should be populated with dynamic metadata, including a unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description" ...>` for each product to ensure good search engine visibility.
*   **Responsiveness:** The page layout must be fully responsive and provide an excellent user experience on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
*   **Accessibility:** The page should adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards to be accessible to all users.

**5. Design and UX**

*   The design should be clean, modern, and consistent with the `yourfitnature-react` brand.
*   The layout should prioritize the product image and the "Add to Cart" button.
*   Use of whitespace and clear typography is essential for readability.
*   The page should be intuitive and easy to navigate.

**6. Data Storage and Management**

*   **Data Source:** Product data is managed in the Sanity.io headless CMS.
*   **Data Fetching:** The application will fetch product data from Sanity using the helper functions in `lib/getProducts.ts`.
*   **Product Model:** The existing `Product` type defined in `lib/getProducts.ts` will be used. It includes fields like `name`, `slug`, `price`, `description`, `images`, etc.
*   **Single Product Fetching:** The function `getProductBySlug(slug: string)` will be implemented in `lib/getProducts.ts` to query the Sanity API for a single product matching the given slug.

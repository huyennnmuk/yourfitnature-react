# PRD: 7-Day Bloating Reset Tracker

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the "7-Day Bloating Reset Tracker," an interactive tool designed to help users identify the root causes of their bloating. Many users struggle with persistent bloating but lack a clear, structured way to connect their daily habits (diet, supplements, etc.) to their symptoms. This tracker provides a simple yet powerful framework for users to log their inputs and outcomes, turning vague feelings into actionable data. The primary goal is to empower users to understand their bodies, recognize patterns, and take the first step toward a long-term solution.

## 2. Goals
- **Empower Users:** Provide users with a tangible tool to actively manage and understand their bloating.
- **Drive Engagement:** Serve as a valuable lead magnet offered after the "Bloating Trigger Detective Quiz" to increase user engagement and email sign-ups.
- **Guide Towards Solutions:** Gently guide users toward relevant content, lifestyle adjustments, and recommended affiliate products based on their logged data.
- **Build Trust:** Reinforce FitNature's authority and commitment to providing practical, science-backed wellness tools.

## 3. User Stories
- **As a user struggling with daily bloating,** I want to track my meals, symptoms, and water intake in one place so that I can identify potential triggers and patterns.
- **As a user who just completed the bloating quiz,** I want a simple, actionable next step so that I can apply what I've learned and start seeing results.
- **As a user looking for natural remedies,** I want to log my use of supplements and see how they affect my symptoms over a week.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1.  The tracker must be available as a downloadable PDF file.
2.  The PDF must be easily printable and also fillable using standard PDF reader software.
3.  The tracker must cover a 7-day period, with a dedicated section for each day.
4.  Each daily section must include fields for logging:
    -   Meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks)
    -   Bloating Symptoms (with fields for severity, timing, and notes)
    -   Water Intake (e.g., number of glasses/liters)
    -   Supplement/Product Use (what was taken and when)
    -   Completed Daily Action Steps (as checkboxes)
    -   A general notes section for additional observations.
5.  The tracker must include a brief introductory section explaining how to use it effectively.
6.  Each day should feature a unique, simple tip or piece of guidance related to reducing bloating.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
-   This feature will **not** be an interactive web application or part of the main website UI for the MVP.
-   There will be **no** user accounts, data storage, or backend integration. The tracker is a standalone file.
-   The tracker will **not** include automated analysis, scoring, or personalized feedback based on user input.
-   There will be **no** push notifications or reminders.

## 6. Design Considerations
-   The design must be clean, modern, and visually aligned with the FitNature brand identity.
-   The layout should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear headings for each section.
-   The tracker should be designed for standard A4/Letter paper size for easy printing.
-   It should incorporate FitNature's logo and color scheme.

## 7. Technical Considerations
-   The final output must be a compressed, web-optimized PDF to ensure fast downloads.
-   The PDF form fields should be configured to be compatible with common PDF readers like Adobe Acrobat Reader, Apple Preview, and modern web browsers.

## 8. Success Metrics
-   **Download Rate:** The number of times the tracker is downloaded after the quiz completion.
-   **User Feedback:** Qualitative feedback from users on the tracker's usefulness and ease of use.
-   **Conversion Rate:** A/B testing the presence of the tracker offer to see if it increases quiz completion or email sign-up rates.

## 9. Open Questions
-   What is the primary call-to-action (CTA) at the end of the 7-day period? (e.g., "Book a consultation," "Read our advanced guide," "Try these recommended products?")

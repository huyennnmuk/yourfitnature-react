# PRD: Single Blog Post Layout

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for creating a standardized, modern, and readable UI layout for single blog posts. The layout will be generated from Markdown files and should be consistent with the design principles of the Perplexity blog. The goal is to enhance the user experience for readers and streamline the content publishing process for creators.

## 2. Goals

*   Standardize the look and feel of all blog posts to ensure brand consistency and professionalism.
*   Improve readability and content navigation for end-users.
*   Enhance content discoverability through features like a Table of Contents and related articles.
*   Provide a better experience for both content creators and readers.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a reader,** I want to see a clear and organized blog post so that I can easily find the information I need.
*   **As a content creator,** I want my posts to appear consistently formatted so readers trust the site and my content looks professional.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The system must render blog posts from Markdown files.
2.  The layout must include a sticky Table of Contents for easy navigation within the post, especially on desktop.
3.  Social sharing buttons for at least three platforms (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) must be included.
4.  The page must display an estimated reading time and/or a progress indicator.
5.  The layout must be responsive and render correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
6.  The system must correctly render all standard Markdown elements, including headings, lists, images, blockquotes, and code snippets.
7.  The layout should gracefully handle posts without a cover image, either by using a fallback or adjusting the layout.
8.  The layout should handle long titles and numerous tags without breaking the UI.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   A comment section is not part of the initial implementation.
*   Advanced features like inline comments or a dark mode toggle are not required for the first version.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   The UI should be modeled after the Perplexity blog layout. The reference link is: [https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/perplexity-partners-with-elevenlabs-to-launch-discover-daily-podcast](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/perplexity-partners-with-elevenlabs-to-launch-discover-daily-podcast)
*   The design must adhere to accessibility standards, including sufficient color contrast and ARIA labels for navigation.
*   Fonts, colors, and spacing should align with the existing Tailwind CSS configuration, with any specific overrides for blog elements documented.
*   Long titles should be handled with truncation or an ellipsis.
*   Tags should wrap responsively or be limited to a certain number with a "+ more" indicator.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   Blog content will be stored as Markdown files in a local directory (`/content/posts`).
*   The application will fetch and parse these files using Next.js's static generation (`getStaticProps`).
*   Analytics tracking (e.g., Google Analytics) for page views should be integrated.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   The page load time for a blog post should be under 2 seconds.
*   All Markdown elements specified in the recipe must be rendered correctly.
*   The Table of Contents must be functional and sticky on desktop views.
*   Social sharing functionality is operational.
*   The layout is verified as responsive across all target devices.

## 9. Open Questions

*   Which specific social media platforms should be prioritized for the sharing buttons?
*   What is the desired behavior for the Table of Contents on mobile devices?
